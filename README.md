# MasterMindGame
MasterMind Game with colors instead of numbers.
Created a visual representation of the guess before the player hits submit so the player has a visual representation of their guess.
When the player hits submit, it will take that array of guessed colors and display them.
Every color that is in the secret code, but not in the right spot will have a yellow border.
Every color that is in the secret code and in the right spot will have a pink border.
